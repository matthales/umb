        <h2>Week 13 - Coaching Calls</h2>
        <p><strong>7 December 2019</strong></p>

        <p>Well, here we are. It’s the end of the class and it has been enjoyable to look back on everything we’ve 
            learned and reflect on the differences between who we were back then versus who we are now, what dialogue 
            meant back then versus what it means now, and so forth. While much of what I have gained will be my own, 
            there were certainly some points in the final coaching calls that resonated between myself and others.</p> 

        <p>One thing we agreed on was that the topic of dialogue is inarguably something we can all use in our daily 
            lives. The concepts are applicable and have great utility in the ways we communicate and build relationships 
            with others. That being said, there were a number of occasions where the material might have been simpler 
            and slightly less scholarly. I found myself scratching my head following some of the readings and hoping 
            I wasn’t the only one who wasn’t quite following what was being said. I don’t doubt that there is value 
            hidden in the complexity, but for myself (and potentially others), it was the first time broaching the 
            topic of dialogue and the curse of knowledge may have made some of the material difficult to absorb at 
            anything beyond a very surface level. However, I do believe that additional time spent studying and 
            cross-referencing the sources would certainly help in getting to the heart of what many of the writers 
            were hoping to convey.</p>

        <p>In terms of what has changed most noticeably in our day to day conversations, it appears at least a few 
            of us have recognized the way we listen as having transformed the most. One idea we discussed behind the 
            reasoning for this is that it is possible that listening is one of the foundational concepts of discourse, 
            which when applied effectively can lead to opportunities to engage in additional concepts of dialogue. 
            Perhaps listening is often the gateway action into exercising more awareness and attempting to identify 
            what a conversation needs in order to be successful.</p>

        <p>All in all, it’s no question that the course has been extremely interesting and will undoubtedly be useful 
            in improving my ability to connect with others. The learnings from the class will also feed well into the 
            subsequent courses I will be taking, making it a perfect introductory course for critical and creative thinking!</p>

        <h2>Week 8 - Coachee Call</h2>
        <p><strong>2 November 2019</strong></p>

        <p>In conversation with my coach this week we touched on a number of interesting elements of listening. 
            The first was around how solution-focused “generative listening” appears to be. The assignment describes 
            the purpose as “unfolding new insights and new discoveries,” which, while useful, seems to have a 
            precondition of needing new insights or discoveries, conceivably in order to make progress in some 
            specific direction. This goal-directed dialogue doesn’t appear to be a part of much of what we would 
            consider to be everyday, mundane conversations with those around us. Perhaps we have yet to see the 
            potential which lies within even the most trivial discussion?</p>

        <p>We also reflected on the role of questions in evolving a conversation toward a generative dynamic. We 
            are both the type of people who often sit back, listen and observe what is taking place in group 
            discussions before lightly participating. Both of our most common forms of contribution take the form 
            of questions, trying to push the dialogue further. While some of those questions may have been prepared 
            beforehand, it is even more important to seek the right questions as the conversation evolves. This 
            concept also led us to reflect on how much of Dialogic Leadership depends on being vocally involved in 
            a discussion. Is it possible to be a leader while taking a minimal amount of airtime in a group setting? 
            One must certainly not be completely silent during the interactions but perhaps there is room to take 
            merely the necessary moments to propel the dialogue forward, without being required to be the one 
            contributing most to what is being said.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <h2>Week 8 - Coach Call</h2>
        <p><strong>2 November 2019</strong></p>

        <p>The topic of listening was timely in the call with my coachee this week. His final project will be a 
            research paper on the topic of listening, so we were able to deep-dive his initial thoughts around the 
            field structures of listening. One of the first things we discussed was the struggles we’ve had around 
            what constitutes “listening for someone’s future potential” as a part of generative listening. My 
            coachee mentioned he could see the utility in using the approach if he was having a conversation with 
            someone he didn’t like and wanted to see in a different light, but he also admitted that scenario isn’t 
            one he typically encounters in life. Is there a connection between listening for someone’s future 
            potential and conflict resolution? It’s an interesting idea to reflect on.</p>

        <p>We also discussed how much of what constitutes the four fields of conversation seems to be things we 
            already unconsciously do when talking with others, though not in exactly the same format Scharmer 
            describes. We reflected together on the possibility that Scharmer’s four fields are a more general 
            approach to conversation and that our own individual versions may vary from his. It’s interesting to 
            consider that my personal fields of conversation might be different from Scharmer’s, though his would 
            be a useful place to start. In the spirit of “all models are wrong,” maybe Scharmer’s is a place to 
            begin and only afterward can we begin to determine what our personal fields of conversation really are. 
            Perhaps a process could even be created which would assist people in transitioning from a general model 
            of conversation to a more uniquely individual one?</p>

        <h2>Week 7 - Coachee Call</h2>
        <p><strong>26 October 2019</strong></p>

        <p>My conversation with my coach this week was an interesting exploration into the assignments from this 
            week. One of the major themes coming out of my time spent in nature was my realization that my “self” 
            and my “work” are both tightly coupled to my relationships with people around me and the environments 
            I attempt to create for them. This led us to have a discussion around what it might mean to be 
            “presencing” alone versus within a group of people. We may have left with more questions than answers - 
            questions like “what are the noticeable differences between presencing as an individual and presencing 
            within a group?”</p>

        <p>Similarly, my coach asked what the “steps” are “to get to presencing.” This took us down the path of part 
            two of the assignment and how my conversations took place throughout the week. I will admit that I am 
            unsure whether or not I truly entered the state of presencing in any of them. One of the ideas that my 
            coach and I discussed was whether or not it is necessary to have each participant in a conversation aware 
            of the fields of conversation and the theory behind them, in order to successfully reach presencing. 
            Beyond being aware of them, it also seems like a prerequisite that people come to a dialogue prepared 
            and ready to dig deep into whatever topic or problem is being focused on. While this may not all be 
            strictly required in order to navigate these fields, it does seem like it would increase the likelihood 
            of reaching a state of presencing if those involved are aware of the theories and attempting, in unison, 
            to reach the highest form of dialogue possible.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>
          
        <p><br></p>
          
        <h2>Week 7 - Coach Call</h2>
        <p><strong>26 October 2019</strong></p>

        <p>Due to conflicts with our usual call time, my call with my coachee ended up taking place a litter earlier 
            in the week. The result was that my coachee hadn’t yet been able to do parts one and two of the assignment. 
            Nonetheless, we had an interesting conversation around his perception of the assignments and how he 
            planned on tackling them.</p>

        <p>There was definitely some incredulity around the purpose of part one, primarily due to my coachee’s 
            extensive background in meditation. He viewed the assignment as a meditative exercise and mentioned 
            specifically that these deep insights regarding the “self” don’t come from a structured, reflective 
            exercise, rather  “these things are supposed to come to you in times of silence.” Going into meditation 
            with a specific goal in mind “degrades the practice.” We talked at length about whether or not the 
            activity was meant to be meditative or more along the lines of a simpler thinking exercise, which added 
            new perspectives to how each of us had interpreted the objective of part one.</p>

        <p>We also had a wonderful conversation around how we would theoretically approach an instance of dialogue 
            where we planned on trying to reach field four. We agreed that it would be a challenge in any sort of 
            brief conversation and that it might be helpful to try and determine beforehand what kinds of “markers” 
            or “signposts to be on the lookout for - markers which indicate moving from one field to the next. As 
            we talked, we inspected the idea that markers might be different person to person and that part of 
            our individual goals going forward was trying to recognize our own actions or words which might signal 
            we have moved to field three or four. The discussion certainly left us each with some next steps in 
            practicing awareness in our conversations as they evolve.</p>

        <h2>Week 6 - Coachee Call</h2>
        <p><strong>19 October 2019</strong></p>

        <p>A couple of topics I covered with my coach this week were the dynamics of suspending with people we know 
            well and suspending as a skill. We discussed the different scenarios of conversing with someone you know 
            really well, for example, close friends or family, and people you’ve only met recently. With strangers or 
            new acquaintances, it seems logical to spend more time being polite in field one. There isn’t a long 
            history of conversation to draw from and judge with, leading to potentially less need for suspension. 
            However, with a family member you’ve known for a lengthy amount of time, there’s much more baggage that 
            could be brought to the forefront of communication. These types of conversations would seem to benefit 
            much more, in comparison, from reflection and suspension of thoughts and judgment.</p>

        <p>We also discussed how suspension is a skill and like any other skill, it requires time and practice to 
            master. Much like how we weren’t professional meditators by the end of last week, neither of us felt 
            like we’d improved much in our abilities after one single week of trying to be more aware of our 
            thoughts and suspend judgment. It definitely appears to be a skill worth learning, but also one that 
            could take considerable time and energy to see real progress with. As it’s also somewhat difficult to 
            measure, it could continue to be a challenge just to see whether or not progress is being made. In 
            spite of this, we both agreed that the most obvious next steps were to continue practicing suspension 
            as a skill and see how it might develop over time.</p>  

        <p><br><br></p>
          
        <p><br></p>
          
        <h2>Week 6 - Coach Call</h2>
        <p><strong>19 October 2019</strong></p>

        <p>Some of the many interesting ideas my coachee shared this week were around the challenges associated 
            with suspending during conversation. For example, while it’s possible to bring awareness to one’s 
            thoughts and feelings while listening, it’s “almost impossible while being the one talking.” I’ve noticed 
            the same difficulties in conversations of my own. It takes a considerable amount of effort, in most cases, 
            to gather my thoughts, determine how I might express them and articulate ideas in such a way that they 
            are moderately understandable to my audience. However, while listening to a conversation partner, it 
            seems to be much easier to vacillate between active listening and self-reflection. Perhaps, at least in 
            my case, the path toward more advanced suspension comes in the form of progressing in my ability to reflect 
            while communicating, without having the action necessarily derail my train of thought.</p>

        <p>In a similar vein, my coachee mentioned how such a level of awareness requires a “ridiculous amount of 
            energy” and that one simply can’t be doing it all the time. My experience has certainly been similar, 
            even just in terms of active listening, let alone in terms of additional levels of awareness. This led 
            us to briefly play with the idea that suspension might be more useful in some situations than others. 
            We didn’t immediately stumble upon when it could be more or less valuable specifically, but I do believe 
            there are conversations where suspending could play a much more critical role. One example might be times 
            where some level of problem-definition or problem-solving is taking place. These types of discussions often 
            have higher stakes and could benefit most from thoughtful dialogue, as opposed to more relaxed conversations 
            with friends or family. This isn’t to say it wouldn’t also improve causal communication, but if a finite 
            amount of energy is available for such intensive conversation, perhaps some semblance of prioritization is 
            required in order to avoid overwhelming oneself.</p>

        <h2>Week 5 - Friday Meditation Reflection</h2>
        <p><strong>11 October 2019</strong></p>

        <p>A few months ago, while first investigating a meditative practice, I was introduced to the analogy of 
            thoughts as a flowing river. We can swim back and forth in the flow of thoughts and chase one idea or 
            the next, or we can simply step out of the river, sit calmly on the banks and observe the thoughts as 
            they float by.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately today I failed miserably in observing my thoughts and constantly splashed from one to the 
            next in the troubled waters of my thought-river. It was another stressful day, though less in negative 
            terms and more in the anxiety of extreme urgency. I was certainly “caught up in the movie that plays” 
            and did not take the time to reflect on or bring awareness to my thoughts.</p>

        <p>I wonder if some of this failure stems from being a novice meditator. I’ve only began an on-and-off 
            meditative practice this year and it seems to be a fairly advanced principle of mindfulness to truly 
            bring attention to the way one’s thought process plays out in their mind. Perhaps the ease of 
            implementing such a technique also varies from one person to the next? In any case, I have an undeniable 
            goal in attaining some measure of awareness in the near future as I continue to build upon my mindfulness 
            practice. Maybe one of these days, hopefully sooner rather than later, I’ll find my spot along the banks 
            of my thought-river and finally be capable of calmly observing my thoughts as they float by!</p>

        <h2>Week 5 - Thursday Meditation Reflection</h2>
        <p><strong>10 October 2019</strong></p>

        <p>Interestingly enough, it appears as though my reflection from Wednesday would have nailed the 
            criteria for today’s post. Though it was an unusually rollercoaster-like day yesterday, today 
            did not disappoint. The prompt from the assignment about whether there were moments of “emotional 
            distress” adequately describes just about every moment at work. The difference, however, came in 
            the way I brought the distress home with me.</p>

        <p>In the past, hard days at work have led to difficult evenings at home. I’ll spend the majority of 
            my time reliving and reviewing the events of the day, which causes the aggravation to persist long 
            into the evening. Transitioning from work to home was a different experience today. With more 
            awareness of my emotional state, I was finally able to compartmentalize the occupational difficulties 
            of the day and leave them at the door as I returned to my family. This may seem small, but it made 
            for significantly more positive interactions with my family, particularly in moments where I would 
            have normally been quick to lose patience.</p>

        <p>The guided meditation I listened to this morning focused on the topic of labeling emotions as they 
            arise. I think this, in part, helped keep many of the negative emotions of the day detached from 
            what I would consider my “self.” Simply putting a label on them helped separate them from me and 
            allowed me to view them as a mildly interested third party might, all the while avoiding the 
            side-effects of being encompassed by them in the moment.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>
          
        <p><br></p>
          
        <h2>Week 5 - Wednesday Meditation Reflection</h2>
        <p><strong>9 October 2019</strong></p>

        <p>I struggled to remember the assignment to exercise a deliberate awareness of breathing today. Luckily, 
            I was able to practice during a particularly visceral moment in time as I drove home from work. 
            Following some unusually aggravating circumstances, I was in an uncharacteristically livid state as 
            I made the trip. It was in this heightened state of emotion that I recalled the guided meditation 
            from this morning and took a moment to focus on how I happened to be breathing at the moment.</p>

        <p>Taking a deep breath and reflecting on my emotional state caused me to take a psychological step back 
            and take a third-person view of the situation. I took note of my impatience, my aggressive maneuvering 
            of the roads and my uncharitable outlook on any other vehicle acting as an obstacle in my way. I 
            wondered how I might look to others around me - to anyone who might steal a glance in my direction 
            and catch me in this particularly agitated state. I found myself looking into other vehicles, 
            searching for anyone else who might be struggling with their emotions. Surprisingly, or perhaps 
            unsurprisingly, I quickly identified others who seemed to be suffering from a similar bout of anger. 
            I was certainly not alone in my difficulty.</p>

        <p>Something did not happen though - the feelings of agitation did not change or disperse. Despite my 
            ability to view them through a lens of detachment, my emotions remained as strong as they’d been 
            from the beginning of my journey. What did change was how I expressed them. I became more patient 
            and my aggression all but disappeared. While I continued to be angry, I was no longer lashing out 
            at any and everything. I was somehow able to separate it from the situations to which it was in no 
            way connected. This seemed to support much of what I’ve experienced from meditation in the past, 
            in the ability to respond to stimulants instead of react. In a scenario where my emotional state 
            would have typically affected each and every action I engaged in for an extended period of time, I 
            was able to put the negativity in a container and set it aside for later retrieval, when it might 
            be more appropriate to convey.</p>

        <h2>Week 5 - Tuesday Meditation Reflection</h2>
        <p><strong>8 October 2019</strong></p>

        <p>Today was an unusual day to have an extra awareness of the way my body interacts with the world around me. 
            I have come to notice the differences in how I respond, physically, to engaging with different forms of 
            content.</p>

        <p>The first example was a highly atypical meeting this morning where I, as a part of a relatively large 
            audience, was required me to sit in one place for nearly four hours. Despite a highly entertaining 
            presenter, I noticed very quickly that I did not agree with the material being presented. I began to 
            be aware of the way my rejection of the content was being manifested physically - folding my arms and 
            leaning back in my chair, constantly fidgeting, feeling uncomfortable no matter how I sat, repeatedly 
            checking my phone, etc. The mental agony seemed to be seeping into the physical space, leading to more 
            than just intellectual boredom.</p>

        <p>This experience sits in stark contrast to the second example of engaging with class materials this evening. 
            While the duration is not quite as long, I routinely sit at my computer for multiple hours in the evening 
            reading class assignments, writing responses or reflections, listening to the podcasts, etc. Yet as I pay 
            more attention this evening, I notice that there is far less physical discomfort associated with the 
            exercises. At first glance, this would appear to be because I find the material to be engaging and 
            intellectually stimulating. While I know that the mind-body connection is strong, this was a particularly 
            visceral exercise and the contrast was much more than I had anticipated.</p>

        <h2>Week 4 - Coaching Calls Reflection</h2>
        <p><strong>5 October 2019</strong></p>

        <p>One recurring theme seemed to surface in each of the coaching calls this week - while Kantor’s Four 
            Player Model seems to be useful in group conversations, it certainly appears to be more difficult to 
            apply in one-on-one conversations. My coachee mentioned that his current company doesn’t have a lot 
            of long meetings, so there are “fewer opportunities to apply the model.” This mentality infers that 
            the model is merely useful is larger, longer conversations and less applicable in briefer or less 
            populated ones. My coach asked directly, while it “seems good for organizations, how does it work 
            with personal relationships?” Our discussion included open questions around how to apply the model 
            with people who are already familiar with one’s typical modes of conversing, and how they might react 
            when one attempts to play out abnormal roles from the model. Lastly, a similar sentiment emerged from 
            the assignment for the second conversation this week, which included sharing the model with coworkers 
            and discussing what aspects of it resonated with them. We quickly moved in the direction of seeing a 
            Dialogic Leader as nearly synonymous with a good facilitator, also inferring it was most useful in 
            facilitated group discussions.</p>

        <p>Despite the direction we all seemed to take in terms of the usefulness of the model, it doesn’t appear 
            to have been built specifically for conversations between large groups of people. The “Structural Dynamics” 
            the model is a tenet of purports to have helped couples, among other groups, and the Dialogic Leadership 
            article itself begins with the interactions between two company’s chairmen.</p> 

        <p>So why might it be that we all struggled to see the application in one-on-one modes of conversing? One 
            theory I have is the idea that the actions in the model are easily referred to as “roles.” In fact, the 
            first assignment for the conversations this week states specifically to practice one or two of the “roles 
            that you are NOT accustomed to doing.” From my point of view, the concept of a “role” is something a person 
            embodies throughout the duration of a specific interaction, as opposed to “actions that a person may take” 
            as Isaacs describes them. When considering a brief conversation with only one other person, it sounds less 
            natural to be playing multiple roles, despite the fact that Dialogic Leadership demands a balance between 
            the actions in the model. Perhaps this is one potential source of the dissonance we seem to be experiencing 
            when attempting to apply Kantor’s model to something other than a group discussion?</p>

        <p>One other possibility was mentioned by my coachee in the idea that “just the term ‘Dialogic Leader’ means a 
            group of people making a decision.” I would agree that the idea of a “leader” seems to imply at least a 
            small gathering of individuals. As an example, if I am having a one-on-one conversation with someone and 
            they are clearly stuck in one of the actions from the Four Player Model, is my imperative to act out all 
            three other actions in response, in order to be the Dialogic Leader in the conversation? It seems to be a 
            tall, and potentially awkward, order. This, of course, all comes with the caveat that we’ve only just now 
            learned of the model and have yet to truly try and apply it on a regular basis. Perhaps many of these 
            uncertainties will simply resolve themselves with time and experience!</p>

        <h2>Week 4 - Conversations Reflection</h2>
        <p><strong>3 October 2019</strong></p>

        <p>In my first conversation, I attempted to practice the roles of Mover and Opposer, which tend to be 
            the actions I take least often. The setting was a weekly touch-base with other Product Managers at 
            my company and our goal was to brainstorm some solutions to a particular problem and then form 
            groups to execute on some of the ideas. It was an interesting environment due to only a few people 
            being physically present, while others called in from other locations. We weren’t able to take 
            advantage of video conferencing, so it became an unusual juggling act of engaging some participants 
            face to face and others through mere disembodied voices. While I can comfortably play the role of 
            Mover at times, I still struggle with challenging others as an Opposer. My primary tendency, when 
            offering an opposing opinion, is to approach it in the form of questions. This approach may 
            straddle the lines of Following and Opposing, in contrast with pure Opposing actions. While that 
            may seem to soften the blow of critical feedback, there’s still plenty of room for improvement in 
            my capacity to challenge others effectively.</p>

        <p>The second conversation was by far the most intriguing. I prepared a handful of brief slides to 
            cover the content of the Four Player Model and facilitated a discussion with four of my coworkers 
            around the associated concepts. I encouraged them to ask questions as they came up and requested 
            that they specifically share what points resonated with them and which points didn’t. A couple of 
            ideas were particularly interesting - the goal of the visual and the difficulty of suspending. 
            While talking through the actions it seemed relatively straightforward that Movers and Opposers 
            were, in a sense, on opposite ends of a spectrum. The confusion surfaced while unpacking Bystanders 
            and Followers - are they similarly diametrically opposed? We didn’t let the question keep us from 
            moving forward through the content, but we weren’t able to come to any sort of agreement on what 
            the visual was attempting to communicate. The second idea I found to be interesting was that 
            suspending is likely the most difficult skill to master among the four practices. It is enough 
            of a challenge to suspend our beliefs about what others are saying, but even more so it is 
            exceptionally difficult to suspend our beliefs about what we, ourselves, are saying. I would 
            agree that such a level of awareness requires a significant amount of work to cultivate and is 
            potentially the most useful practice to learn.</p>

        <p>The third conversation was with somebody I have had a hard time communicating with throughout 
            the recent few weeks. It was ad-hoc and relatively unstructured but surprisingly went very well. 
            I mostly took the role of the Mover, but frequently asked him what I might be missing, in an 
            attempt to encourage him to Follow and Oppose. Despite being a brief conversation, I think it 
            was the first successful interaction I’ve had with this person yet. He even mentioned at the end 
            of our chat that it was a pleasant surprise and I should swing by more often.</p>

        <h2>Week 3 - Coach Call</h2>
        <p><strong>28 September 2019</strong></p>

        <p>For my first experience of being a coach, this week’s coaching call certainly exceeded my 
            expectations! My initial expectation was that the conversation might feel somewhat forced or 
            awkward at moments, but it seemed to flow relatively freely from one topic to the next. It’s 
            hard to say what the biggest contributors might have been, but I do believe my coachee is an 
            easy person to have a conversation with, which is a good start.</p>

        <p>From my side, I believe I did a decent job listening, summarizing and questioning, even attempt 
            to catalyze on one topic which may or may not have resonated. Some of the effects may only 
            manifest with time. One key process I do not think I engaged in was “mirroring.” Initially, 
            I did not remember what it entailed, but having read over it again I find myself struggling 
            with the definition. It seems to significantly overlap with questioning, which means I may just 
            have to spend more time digging into it to understand how to employ it more effectively.</p> 

        <p>By the end of the call, my coachee mentioned he had enjoyed the conversation and it had helped him 
            think about things differently. We closed by discussing what my role might look like as a coach 
            going forward and it seems to revolve around helping see things at a higher level - asking questions 
            like “where do you want to go with this?”, “what is your end goal?”, “where are you now?”, and “where 
            do you want to go next?” These questions could help ensure deliberate orientation as we travel 
            through the course material and look for opportunities to apply it within our individual lives.</p>

        <h2>Week 3 - Coachee Call</h2>
        <p><strong>28 September 2019</strong></p>

        <p>What is it like to be coached? What should it be like? These questions seemed to be driving 
            the call for this first coaching session. With each of us being new to the concept of coaching, 
            we began with significant room to grow. The session turned into a wonderful opportunity for 
            each of us to explore different ideas around what to expect from a coach.</p>

        <p>One interesting concept my coach mentioned was from material covered earlier in the course. 
            The idea was that we shouldn’t necessarily expect to leave each conversation with an answer 
            to whatever question we entered it with. Tying this in with coaching, should the expectation 
            be that a coach helps their coachee toward resolving some particular issue or question? Is 
            resolution even the goal?</p>

        <p>The lecture for the week states that the job of a coach is to “support the learning” of the person 
          they are coaching and to help their coachee “reflect on the communication practices” in each assignment. 
          These goals seem to support the idea that coaching is potentially less about problem-solving and more 
          about problem-discussion.</p>

        <p>These ideas shifted my characterization of coaching by emphasizing the role of a coach as a guide, or 
            a partner, in moving forward toward a better understanding of the topics at hand. A complete 
            understanding by the end of each call is not the expectation, rather the coach acts as a catalyst 
            for articulating ideas differently or reframing ideas in ways which allow the coachee to explore 
            them from new angles.</p>

        <h2>Week 3 - Coaching Summary</h2>
        <p><strong>24 September 2019</strong></p>

        <p>In his book Dialogue and the Art of Thinking Together, Bill Isaacs states: “we can influence 
            and regenerate the inner ecology of human beings by transforming the quality of our conversations” 
            (pg. 308). Even more directly, “the way we talk impacts the way we think.” A good coach is someone 
            who encourages the kind of dialogue which helps a person regenerate their inner ecology. Through 
            tactics like active listening, summarizing, and questioning, a coach is able to assist another 
            person toward a better articulation of their thoughts and feelings. While it’s a deeply collaborative 
            effort, the coach will likely spend most of the conversation using prompts to help their coachee work 
            through something for which they haven’t quite found the words.</p>

        <p>This process of “thinking together” can have a profound effect on the coachee, as Bill Isaacs describes 
            it: “to help human beings to untie their own knots and liberate themselves” (pg. ix). This process 
            includes helping a person reflect on their thoughts, discover the source of their ideas and uncover 
            ways they might more fully express themselves in a truthful and articulate manner. It is a partnership 
            in unraveling the mystery surrounding an individual and their thought process. This would then, in turn, 
            alter the way the coachee sees the world and allow them to discover new ways of understanding their 
            surroundings and other people.</p>

        <p>For me, a great coach would help me to better understand the way I am perceived by, and interact with, 
            other people. My occupation requires a good portion of my time to be filled with the creation and 
            maintaining of human relationships, from members of my direct team to various stakeholders. It also 
            includes customers and other end-users with whom I interact on a regular basis in order to understand 
            their needs and concerns. Each of these interactions could be improved by transforming the quality of 
            conversation and learning how to better engage in generative dialogue. We’re often navigating through 
            complex spaces with potentially opposing goals, searching for some semblance of common ground. While I 
            have been relatively successful in building relationships in the recent past, there is still plenty of 
            opportunity to connect with others on a deeper, more human level.</p>

        <p>Lastly, I believe a good coach is somebody who eventually makes themselves irrelevant. The process of 
            supporting someone through the untying of their own knots and liberating themselves should include 
            putting structures in place which no longer necessitate the further assistance of the coach. In fact, 
            the coachee should be aware of what elements of the dialogue are helping them and how, so they can 
            continue to improve while outside the safety net of a coach’s conversation. This process should lead 
            to a regenerated inner ecology which can, in turn, reach out to and improve the inner ecology of other 
            human beings. “Change in one part of that ecology can have impacts on the whole of the ecology, 
            precisely because it is a living system” (pg. 308). The end-goal of the coach should be a positive 
            shift in the ecology which goes on to affect the entire system.</p>
